# Dynamic Web Page

This is a dynamic web page that allows users to customize the theme, enter their name, and displays the current date and time.

## Features

- Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes by clicking the "Toggle Theme" button. The selected theme preference is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists across page loads.

- Dynamic Heading Update: Users can enter their name in a text box and press a button to update the heading with a personalized greeting. The user's name is retrieved from the query string or, if not available, from the local storage.

- Current Date and Time: The web page displays the current date and time when it is loaded. The date and time are updated dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheets for styling the web page and implementing the theme toggle.
- JavaScript: Scripting language for dynamic functionality, including theme toggling, heading update, and date/time display.
- Local Storage: Browser feature used to store and retrieve user preferences.
